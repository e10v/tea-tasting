**tea-tasting** is a Python package for the statistical analysis of A/B tests featuring:

- Student's t-test, Z-test, Bootstrap, and quantile metrics out of the box.
- Extensible API: define and use statistical tests of your choice.
- [Delta method](https://alexdeng.github.io/public/files/kdd2018-dm.pdf) for ratio metrics.
- Variance reduction with [CUPED](https://exp-platform.com/Documents/2013-02-CUPED-ImprovingSensitivityOfControlledExperiments.pdf)/[CUPAC](https://doordash.engineering/2020/06/08/improving-experimental-power-through-control-using-predictions-as-covariate-cupac/) (also in combination with the delta method for ratio metrics).
- Confidence intervals for both absolute and percentage change.
- Sample ratio mismatch check.
- Power analysis.
- Multiple hypothesis testing (family-wise error rate and false discovery rate).

**tea-tasting** calculates statistics directly within data backends such as BigQuery, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Spark, and 20+ other backends supported by [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/). This approach eliminates the need to import granular data into a Python environment, though Pandas DataFrames are also supported.

Check out the [blog post](https://e10v.me/tea-tasting-analysis-of-experiments/) explaining the advantages of using **tea-tasting** for the analysis of A/B tests.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tea-tasting
```

## Basic example

```python
import tea_tasting as tt


data = tt.make_users_data(seed=42)

experiment = tt.Experiment(
    sessions_per_user=tt.Mean("sessions"),
    orders_per_session=tt.RatioOfMeans("orders", "sessions"),
    orders_per_user=tt.Mean("orders"),
    revenue_per_user=tt.Mean("revenue"),
)

result = experiment.analyze(data)
print(result)
#>             metric control treatment rel_effect_size rel_effect_size_ci pvalue
#>  sessions_per_user    2.00      1.98          -0.66%      [-3.7%, 2.5%]  0.674
#> orders_per_session   0.266     0.289            8.8%      [-0.89%, 19%] 0.0762
#>    orders_per_user   0.530     0.573            8.0%       [-2.0%, 19%]  0.118
#>   revenue_per_user    5.24      5.73            9.3%       [-2.4%, 22%]  0.123
```

## Roadmap

- Support more dataframes with [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals).
- A/A tests and simulations.
- More statistical tests:
    - Asymptotic and exact tests for frequency data.
    - Mannâ€“Whitney U test.
- Sequential testing.

## Package name

The package name "tea-tasting" is a play on words that refers to two subjects:

- [Lady tasting tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea) is a famous experiment which was devised by Ronald Fisher. In this experiment, Fisher developed the null hypothesis significance testing framework to analyze a lady's claim that she could discern whether the tea or the milk was added first to the cup.
- "tea-tasting" phonetically resembles "t-testing" or Student's t-test, a statistical test developed by William Gosset.
